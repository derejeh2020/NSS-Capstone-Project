Airline-On-Time-Performance|NSS-Capstone-Project

On-time performance is one of the major factors for the success of an airline. The objective of this analysis is to point out factors that effect On-Time Performance by taking a dataset from the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics and other sources as necessary and come up with some recommendations.

Data QuestionS

1. Do older planes suffer more delays?
2. How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
3. Can we detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others?
4. How does flight patterns change before and after 9/11?
5. How does flight patterns change before and after Covid-19?


Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

   The MVP for this Capstone Project would be to deliver a detailed analysis report and an executive summary for Us commercial airlines to show the major areas of focus to increase On-Time Performance and minimize delays.

Data Sources

The primary source would be Airline and Airports dataset from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Other data sources would be used as needed to support the analysis.
